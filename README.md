# gtk-synce
gtk-synce is a status viewer and software manager for Windows CE devices. gtk-synce is written in C and GTK+2 for Linux and *BSD. The software manager installs CAB files only. See the synce project for other utilities.

## Background
This an old open source project I started as a front end to [SynCE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/synce). The original code is still hosted at [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-synce). The code hosted here is an import from CVS using reposurgeon. 

## Build
There are additional instructions in the old README and INSTALL files.

1. `./autogen.sh`
1. `./configure`
1. `make`
